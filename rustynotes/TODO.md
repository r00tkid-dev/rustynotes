1. Undo/Redo Functionality
Implement an undo/redo stack to keep track of changes made to the note content, allowing users to revert to a previous state or redo an undone change.

2. Tagging/Organization for Notes
Add a simple tagging system or directory structure within `.notes` folder. For example: 
`:tag <tag_name>` or `:move <note> <folder>` could allow users to organize notes better.

3. Search Enhancements
Enhance the search functionality by allowing searching across multiple notes or even by date range or tags. For example: 
`:search <term> --all` to search across all notes.

4. Autosave Customization
Allow users to toggle autosave on/off or set the frequency of autosave. For example, :autosave on or :autosave 5 to save every 5 minutes.

5. File Preview (Quick View)
Add a :preview <note> command to show a brief snippet (first few lines) of a noteâ€™s content.
- Floating Window would be nice...

6. Custom File Extensions

7. Settings/Preferences Menu
- Autosave intervals
- Whether multi-line mode is active by default
- Whether commands like :list show more or fewer notes at once

8. Command History (History of previous inputs)

9. Find and Replace
Implement a `:find <term>` command to search for a term, and a `:replace <term> <replacement>` to replace all occurrences of that term. It could also allow for case-sensitive or whole-word-only search options.

10. Code Folding
Implement a folding mechanism where users can collapse/expand sections of code. For example, the user could press `:fold` to collapse a block and `:unfold` to reveal it again. It could work based on indentation or specific markers like `/* fold start */` and `/* fold end */`.

11. Syntax Highlighting (Not sure/ Low Prio)
Detect the language based on file extension (e.g., `.js` for JavaScript, `.py` for Python) and highlight keywords, variables, and syntax in the appropriate color. You could use simple rules or an external library like `syntect` for better results.
